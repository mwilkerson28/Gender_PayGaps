# Gender_PayGaps
This is a project I completed that analyzes the salary gap between men and women in different regions, industries, and education levels, based on a survey I found online titled "Ask a Manager 2021 Salary Survey." You can find it here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPS5dBSGtwYVbjsfbaMCYIWnOuRmJcbequohNxCyGVw/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1625408792#gid=1625408792
(The results of this project cannot be applied to the US Population as a whole.)
